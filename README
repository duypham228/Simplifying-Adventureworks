Experimenting with AdventureWorks on your local system 
+ JDBC connectivity, JAVA GUI (see java/ directory)

1. Download AdventureWorks database from

  https://sourceforge.net/projects/awmysql/

  and unzip it to produce AWBackup.sql. 

  AdventureWorks is an example database made public by Microsoft.

2. Create a docker directory with the docker-compose.yml file provided here.

- Note: username root, password: password 
- You MUST change the above in the docker-compose.yml file for security.
- In the examples below, I will assume that the default password is used.
- You will use these credentials to connect to your MySQL server
- Move the AWBackup.sql file to this directory.

*  See https://medium.com/@chrischuck35/how-to-create-a-mysql-instance-with-docker-compose-1598f3cc1bee 

3. Start the container

- run

  docker.compose up -d

4. Populate your MySQL server with the data. You only need to do this once.

- run

  mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u root  -ppassword < AWBackup.sql 

- this will take a while, and once it is done, you'll be dropped back to
  your prompt

5. Login to your MySQL server

-run

  mysql --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3306 -u root  -ppassword

6. Try out some commands

-run 

  use adventureworks; 
  show tables;
  show columns from customer;
  select * from customer where AccountNumber="AW00029475";

7. Stop the container when you're done

- run

  docker-compose stop 

8. When you start the container again later and connect to your MySQL server,
you will find that the adventureworks DB is alive and well. Don't forget to do

  use adventureworks;
